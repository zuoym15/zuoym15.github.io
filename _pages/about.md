I'm a second year M.S. in Robotics ([MSR](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-robotics/)) student in the [Robitics Instititute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). My research advisor is [Prof. Katerina Fragkiadaki](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~katef/). I received my B.Eng. in Electornic Engineering in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm) in 2019. Even before that, I finished my high school in the [High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China](http://www.rdfz.cn/en/) (RDFZ) in 2015.


Research Interests
======
My research interests are mainly 3D Computer Vision, Unsupervised Learning, and other computer vision appilcations such as Object Tracking and Cognitive Robotics. My long-term goal is to discover effective ways of building lifelong learning systems that can mine data from the environment, learn in an unsupervised manner, and continue to improve itself with minimal human intervention. I believe such systems can hugely benefit the human society and are an important stepping stone to Artificial General Intelligence.
