I'm a Final year Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/). My current research advisor is [Prof. Jia Deng](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jiadeng/). I received my M.S. degree from the [Robitics Instititute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), working with [Prof. Katerina Fragkiadaki](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~katef/). I received my B.Eng. in Electronic Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm) in 2019.

My research focus is 3D computer vision. I'm especially interested in 3D scene reconstruction and relevant techniques, including monocular depth estimation, depth completion, and multi-view scene reconstruction and rendering. Since real-world data with high quality 3D ground-truth is expensive and laborious to collect, I'm also interested in creating diverse and photo-realistic synthetic data using procedural generation. My long-term research goal is to create an immersive user experience for augmented reality and telepresence on edge devices.

I'm a big fan of animals. In my spare time, I do birding and wildlife photography. Check out my selected [photo gallery](https://zuoym15.github.io/gallery/)!
