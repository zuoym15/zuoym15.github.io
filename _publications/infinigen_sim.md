## Abstract
We introduce Infinigen-Articulated, a toolkit for generating realistic, procedurally generated articulated assets for robotics simulation. We include procedural generators for 18 common articulated object categories along with high-level utilities for use creating custom articulated assets in Blender. We also provide an export pipeline to integrate the resulting assets along with their physical properties into common robotics simulators. Experiments demonstrate that assets sampled from these generators are effective for movable object segmentation, training generalizable reinforcement learning policies, and sim-to-real transfer of imitation learning policies.
